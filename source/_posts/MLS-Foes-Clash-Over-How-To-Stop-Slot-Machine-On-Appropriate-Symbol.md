#  MLS Foes Clash Over How To Stop Slot Machine On Appropriate Symbol

When it comes to how best to stop unauthorized slot machines in the MLS, there is much dissension between foes of the devices. The two major camps are those who feel that a $2,000 symbol should be placed prominently on all such machines and those who believe that government regulation will do more to end the scourge than anything else.

Those in support of the prominent symbol feel that this will make it crystal clear to both business owners and customers which machines are part of the legal, regulated gaming industry and which ones are not. They also believe that this will help authorities better track and monitor unauthorized slot machines, as well as reduce their proliferation.

Opponents of the prominent symbol argue that it is an ineffective solution. They maintain that many business owners will simply ignore the symbol or find ways to circumvent it, while customers will still find ways to play on unauthorized slot machines. Furthermore, they contend that government regulation is necessary in order to effectively address the issue of unauthorized slot machines.



Which side do you fall on? Are you in favor of a prominent symbol or do you believe that government regulation is necessary? Let us know in the comments below!

#  Portland Timbers Urge MLS To Use Common Sense In Stopping Slot Machine

The Portland Timbers have issued a statement urging MLS to use common sense in stopping the "slot machine" that has caused coaches such as Sigi Schmid and Dominic Kinnear to lose their jobs.

"We feel that it's important for MLS to use common sense and put an end to this slot machine," said Timbers owner Merritt Paulson. "It's not fair for coaches like Sigi Schmid and Dominic Kinnear to lose their jobs because of this."

The slot machine has been a big issue in MLS this season, as it has caused coaches to lose their jobs while also turning players into stars. Atlanta United manager Gerardo Martino was recently named coach of the year, despite the team having the second-worst record in the league.

Martino's success is due in part to the fact that he had the benefit of a stacked roster, thanks in part to the slot machine.

"It's not right that coaches are losing their jobs because of this," said Timbers midfielder Diego Valeri. "MLS should put an end to it so that everyone can compete on a level playing field."

#  FC Dallas Calls For San Jose Earthquakes To Be Punished After Sloppy Play

Ahead of their matchup this Saturday, FC Dallas is calling for the San Jose Earthquakes to be punished after some sloppy play.

"We're not happy with how they play," said midfielder Michael Barrios. "They are a dirty team and they don't respect the rules."

In particular, FC Dallas was upset with how San Jose played in their previous match on July 15th. The Earthquakes were awarded a penalty kick in the 94th minute which led to their game-winning goal.

"They fouled us all game and the referee didn't do anything about it," complained defender Matt Hedges. "It's not fair when a team like that can get away with playing dirty."

Despite the language barrier, San Jose striker Chris Wondolowski was able to understand what FC Dallas was saying. "I think they're just mad because we beat them," laughed Wondolowski. "We're not a dirty team, we just play hard and sometimes things happen."

Although FC Dallas may feel that the Quakes have been playing unfairly, there is no evidence that suggests that San Jose has been deliberately breaking the rules. In fact, it could be argued that they are simply playing an aggressive style of football that occasionally results in fouls.

Regardless of who is right and who is wrong, Saturday's match should be an exciting one to watch. Both teams are fighting for a playoff spot and neither will back down from a challenge.

#  LA Galaxy Aim To Shut Down New York Red Bulls In Bout For First Place

The LA Galaxy will be looking to take down the New York Red Bulls on Sunday night in order to solidify their first-place standing in the Western Conference.

The Galaxy are coming into this matchup hot, having won their last three games. Rookie phenom Julian Araujo has been a huge part of that success, scoring two goals and recording one assist over that span.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic is also coming off a quality performance, notching his 12th goal of the season in last week's win over FC Dallas.

The Red Bulls, meanwhile, are coming into this matchup having lost two of their last three games. They'll be looking to redemption against the Galaxy after suffering a 3-1 defeat at the hands of LA back in May.

Designated Player Alejandro Romero "Kaku" Gamarra has been a bright spot for the Red Bulls this season, registering nine goals and seven assists so far. He'll be looking to add to those totals against the Galaxy on Sunday night.

#  Seattle Sounders Look to Put a Stop to Vancouver Whitecaps' Winning Streak

The Seattle Sounders will be looking to put an end to the Vancouver Whitecaps' winning streak when they clash on Saturday at CenturyLink Field.

The Whitecaps (6-4-1) are coming off a 2-0 victory over FC Dallas, which extended their winning streak to four games. Christian Bola√±os and Alphonso Davies scored for Vancouver in the victory.

Seattle (3-5-2) is coming off a 2-1 loss to Sporting Kansas City, which snapped their two-game winning streak. Clint Dempsey and Jordan Morris scored for Seattle in the loss.

Saturday's match will be the first of two meetings between the two clubs this season. The two clubs met twice last season with each club winning their home game.

Both clubs are tied for fourth place in the Western Conference with 15 points each.
