# How to Play Roulette

To play roulette, you first need to place a bet on the table. The table will have a variety of betting options, including red or black, odd or even, and numbers 1-36. Once you have placed your bet, the dealer will spin the roulette wheel and then drop a white ball into the wheel’s track. The ball will eventually come to rest on one of the numbers on the wheel, and if your bet matches the number where the ball lands, you will win!

# What Happens If You Win

If you win a bet on black or red, your payout will be 1:1. That means for every dollar you bet, you will receive one dollar back plus your original bet amount. If you win a bet on odd or even, your payout will be 1:1 as well. However, if you win a bet on a specific number, your payout will be 35:1. So if you bet $10 on a number and it wins, you would receive $350 back (plus your initial $10 bet).
