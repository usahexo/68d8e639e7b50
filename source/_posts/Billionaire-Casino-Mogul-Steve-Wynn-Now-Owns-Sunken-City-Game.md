#  Billionaire Casino Mogul Steve Wynn Now Owns Sunken City Game

What do a casino mogul and a sunken city have in common?

They’re both now owned by Steve Wynn.

The billionaire casino mogul has just purchased the popular sunken city game for an undisclosed amount. The game, which is currently available on both the App Store and Google Play, has reportedly been downloaded over 5 million times.

In a statement released by Wynn, he said that he was “thrilled to be able to add Sunken City to my growing gaming portfolio.” He went on to say that he plans on making the game even more popular than it already is and that he looks forward to bringing it to new markets around the world.

Sunken City is a puzzle game in which players must navigate their way through a sunken city by solving puzzles. The game has already been praised by critics for its clever puzzles and beautiful graphics.

Wynn’s purchase of Sunken City comes shortly after his purchase of another popular mobile game, Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 Plus.

#  MGM Resorts International Makes Play For Sunken City Game Rights

MGM Resorts International announced today their intention to purchase the rights to develop a sunken city video game from current rights holders Sunken City LLC. While the financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed, industry experts expect MGM to pay upwards of $100 million for the exclusive rights.

“We are very excited about this opportunity to create an interactive experience that brings players into the heart of this fascinating and mysterious city,” said Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International.

The Sunken City game will be developed in conjunction with VR specialists Lyteshot Inc., who will supply the app’s augmented reality capabilities. Players will explore the ruins of the lost city, seeking out its secrets and dodging dangers at every turn.

In a statement released by Sunken City LLC, company spokesperson David Dean had this to say: “We are confident that MGM is the perfect partner to take Sunken City to the next level. They have a proven track record in casino gaming and interactive entertainment, and we believe they will do justice to this rich and exciting setting.”

With virtual reality becoming ever more popular, it is no surprise that video game developers are looking to capitalize on its success. The Sunken City game is scheduled for release in late 2018.

#  Caesars Entertainment Group In Talks To Acquire Sunken City Game

According to a recent report by The Wall Street Journal, Caesars Entertainment Group is in talks to acquire the popular mobile game Sunken City.

The move could see the casino giant snap up the game's developer, PlayRaven, for a reported $100 million.

Founded in 2013, PlayRaven is a Helsinki-based studio that has developed several popular mobile games, including Sunken City. The game is a strategy title set in the deep sea, where players must build underwater cities and battle rivals for control of the ocean floor.

Sunken City has been downloaded more than 10 million times since it was released in early 2018. It is currently one of the most popular games on Apple's App Store, and has been praised by critics for its fun and innovative gameplay.

If the acquisition goes ahead, it would be Caesars' first major move into the gaming industry since it acquired social casino game maker Playtika for $4.4 billion in 2016.

A spokesperson for Caesars declined to comment on the reports.

#  Gaming Company Zynga In Talks To Buy Out Sunken City Game

According to a report from Reuters, gaming company Zynga is in talks to buy out the popular mobile game Sunken City.

The game, which has been downloaded over 50 million times, is a puzzle title in which players must restore a city that has been flooded.

Zynga is no stranger to buying out popular mobile games - the company acquired Words With Friends (a Scrabble-like game) back in 2012 for $US150 million.

It's not clear how much Zynga is looking to pay for Sunken City, but it's likely that the acquisition would be in the tens of millions of dollars.
