#  You Could Win Over $1,000,000 Playing Black Jack in Bolivia!

Sure, you could go to Las Vegas and put your luck to the test at the blackjack tables, but why not try something new? Head to Bolivia instead!

If you're looking to up the stakes a bit, you can play blackjack in one of the many casinos in Bolivia. With table limits ranging from $1 to $10,000 or more, there's something for everyone. And if you're feeling lucky, you could walk away with a million bucks or more!

Just be sure to brush up on the rules of blackjack before hitting the casino floor. In Bolivia, dealers deal out two cards to each player and the dealer, with the aim of achieving a hand total of 21 without going over (or busting). The Ace is worth 1 or 11 points, face cards are worth 10 points each, and other card values are as per standard poker rankings.

Players can choose to "stand" (take no additional cards), "hit" (take another card), or "double down" (double their bet and receive one more card). If their hand total exceeds 21 (a bust), they lose automatically.

So what are you waiting for? Pack your bags and head to Bolivia for a chance at millionaire status!

#  Some of the Best Black Jack Odds in the World are Found in Bolivia

In the town of Santa Cruz, in the eastern Bolivian province of Santa Cruz, lies one of the best blackjack odds in the world. The Casino Hotel Royal offers a game with a 3.5% house edge. That is considerably lower than most casinos around the world, where the house edge is usually around 1%. 

When playing blackjack in Bolivia, be sure to ask for “La Partida”. This is the Spanish term for blackjack and it is what you will want to be playing if you want to take advantage of these better odds. In general, when playing casino games in Bolivia, be sure to ask for the specific game that you are interested in before sitting down at a table. There may be slight variations in rules from one casino to the next. 

There are a number of other great gambling options in Santa Cruz as well. The city is home to four casinos: Casino Hotel Royal, Juego de la Fortuna (located inside the Hotel Presidente), Casino Sporting Club, and Casino del Oriente. These casinos all have their own unique offerings, so it’s worth checking out each one before making your final decision about where to play. 

One thing to keep in mind if you do choose to gamble in Bolivia is that there are some restrictions on how much money you can bring into the country. You are allowed to bring in up to $10,000 U.S., but anything over that amount will need to be declared at customs. It’s also important to keep track of your winnings and report them when you leave the country; otherwise you may face fines or even arrest.
