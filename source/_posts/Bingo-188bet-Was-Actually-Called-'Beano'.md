#  Bingo 188bet Was Actually Called 'Beano'

There are a lot of misconceptions about the origin of bingo. Some people think that it is named after the Italian game of bagnone, others believe that it is named after the French game of beano. In reality, bingo is actually named after the British game of beano.

The first recorded instance of beano being played was in a London church in the early 1700s. The game was originally played by children, who would use beans to mark their cards. The name beano is believed to have come from the term 'been there, done that'.

In the early 1800s, a variation of beano called 'Lotto' began to spread throughout Europe. This version of the game used numbered tickets instead of cards, and players would win if they could match all of the numbers on their ticket.

In 1892, a man named Edwin S Lowe reinvented Lotto for American audiences and renamed it bingo. Lowe reduced the number of numbers on each ticket from 24 to 15, and replaced the beans with small wooden discs. He also introduced a new element to the game - the bingo caller.

Bingo quickly became popular in America and soon spread to other parts of the world. Today, it is enjoyed by millions of people all over the world. Thanks to Edwin S Lowe, we can all enjoy this fun and exciting game!

Gambling has been around for centuries and is enjoyed by millions of people all over the world. There are many different types of gambling games, but one of the most popular is bingo. Bingo has been around for hundreds of years and was originally a game of lotto.

If they have a match, they win the prize associated with that number.

Like lotto, bingo can be played in many different ways. Players can either purchase cards with pre-printed numbers or play online where random numbers are generated for each game. There are also many different bingo variations, including blackout, speed bingo, and progressive jackpot bingo.
