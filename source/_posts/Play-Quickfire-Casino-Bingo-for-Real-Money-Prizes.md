#  New Microgaming Quickfire Casino Bingo Games

Online bingo has been around since the late 1990s, but it’s only in the last few years that the game has taken off in a big way. In 2017, the global online bingo market was worth more than $2.5 billion and is expected to grow to $4.7 billion by 2022.

Microgaming, one of the biggest providers of online casino games, has been quick to recognize this growth and has been expanding its range of bingo games in recent months. The company has just released three new Quickfire bingo games – BINGO Lingo, BANK-O-MATIC and BINGO Bonanza.

BINGO Lingo is a 75-ball game with a unique 5x5 grid layout. This makes the game more challenging and exciting than traditional 90-ball bingo. Players can win up to 1,000 coins in each game.

BANK-O-MATIC is a 90-ball game that features a fun Bankers bonus round. In this round, players can win up to 150x their bet amount. There’s also a progressive jackpot that starts at $1,000 and grows with each game played.

BINGO Bonanza is a 75-ball game with an autoplay feature that lets players bet on up to 12 cards at once. This makes the game perfect for high rollers who want to maximize their chances of winning big prizes. The top payout in this game is an impressive 10,000 coins.
