#  5 Ways to Block Gambling Apps on Your iPhone 

If you're like most people, you probably don't want to gamble. But if you have an iPhone, there's a good chance there are gambling apps on it, whether you've installed them yourself or they came pre-installed.

Here are five ways to block gambling apps on your iPhone:

1. Use Restrictions

The first way is to use Restrictions. This is a feature built into iOS that lets you block certain types of apps and content. To use it:

1) Open the Settings app and go to General > Restrictions.
2) Tap Enable Restrictions if the button is grayed out.
3) Enter your passcode. 
4) Under the Apps section, tap Don't Allow Apps Over Wi-Fi. 
5) Turn off Safari by tapping the switch next to it so that it turns white. 
6) Close the Settings app.

Now, any time someone tries to open a gambling app on your iPhone, they'll see a message saying that the app isn't allowed because of restrictions you've put in place.

2. Disable App Store References in Settings 
Another way to block gambling apps is by disabling App Store references in Settings. This won't stop gambling apps from being installed altogether, but it will make it more difficult for people to find them since they won't show up in search results or related recommendations. To do this: 
1) Open the Settings app and go to General > iPhone Storage or iPad Storage (depending on which device you're using).  22) Tap Show All Apps and then look for apps with Gambling in the title or developer name. 
3) Tap on any of those apps and then scroll down and tap Disable App Store References. 
4) Close the Settings app. 

Now, when someone tries to open the App Store and look for gambling apps, they'll be directed to a blank screen instead. And if they try to search for gambling apps specifically, they won't find them unless they know exactly where to look. disabling App Store References also disables automatic updates for those apps, so you don't have to worry about them being automatically updated without your knowledge.

2) Enable restrictions if you haven't already.

#  How to Keep Gambling Apps from Ruining Your Day

In the United States, gambling apps are a big business. Though they are not as popular as in some other countries, they are still enjoyed by millions of people. The problem is that many people can’t seem to resist the temptation to gamble more than they should, and this can lead to disaster.

If you’re one of those people who have a hard time resisting gambling apps, there are a few things you can do to keep them from ruining your day. First, be honest with yourself about how much money you can afford to lose. If you set a limit for yourself and stick to it, you’ll be less likely to end up in debt or even bankruptcy.

Second, make sure that you have enough money saved up so that you don’t have to rely on gambling apps to get by. This may seem like common sense, but it’s surprising how many people lose all their money gambling. Finally, if you find that you’re struggling with addiction, seek help from a professional therapist or counselor.
