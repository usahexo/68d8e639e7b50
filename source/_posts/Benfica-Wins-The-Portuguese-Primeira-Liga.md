#  Benfica Wins The Portuguese Primeira Liga

For the first time in five years, Benfica have been crowned champions of Portugal’s Primeira Liga. The Eagles’ victory was confirmed with a 3-1 win away to Vitoria Setubal on the final day of the season.

Benfica took an early lead through Jardel, but were pegged back by Gaston Sangoy midway through the second half. However, Pizzi and Gonçalo Guedes sealed the victory for the visitors late on to secure their 36th league title.

It has been a dominant season for Benfica, who have only lost twice in the league all season. They also reached the final of the Portuguese Cup, where they will face holders Sporting CP later this month.

#  Porto Finishes Second, While Sporting Clube de Portugal Takes Third

 

The 101st season of the Primeira Liga, Portugal’s top-flight football league, drew to a close on Sunday. Two of its biggest clubs, FC Porto and Sporting CP, competed in the final match for first and second place. The former finished in second after a 1-1 tie, while Sporting took third.

Porto’s performance this year was impressive. In 28 league games, they won 20, drew six and only lost twice – both against Sporting CP. They tallied 66 points in total; just two behind champions Benfica. This consistent level of play has resulted in them being crowned runners-up for the fourth time in six seasons.

Sporting CP had a more up-and-down campaign. While their defence was one of the best in the league (conceding just 26 goals), they often struggled to score; netting only 47 times in 38 matches. Nevertheless, they accumulated 59 points and secured an automatic Champions League spot for next season.

There were plenty of standout players this season in Portugal’s top flight. For Porto, Spanish striker Álvaro Morata was impressive with 17 goals; Brazilian midfielder Jesús Corona was also influential with nine goals and 15 assists, while defender Éder Militão was immense at the back. At Sporting CP, veteran striker Bas Dost led the scoring charts with 27 goals, while midfielder Bruno Fernandes impressed with nine goals and 16 assists.

#  Rio Ave and Chaves Battle for Fourth Place in the Final Matchday

The final matchday of the Liga NOS season is here with a clash between Rio Ave and Chaves for fourth place.

Rio Ave come into this clash in fine form, having won their last two league matches. They currently sit in fifth place in the league table with 52 points, four points behind Chaves. A win in this match would see them leapfrog Chaves into fourth place and secure Champions League qualification.

Chaves are also in good form, having won their last four league matches. They sit in fourth place in the league table with 56 points, three points ahead of Rio Ave. However, a loss in this match would see them fall to fifth place and miss out on Champions League qualification.

Both teams have some injury concerns ahead of this match. For Rio Ave, centre back Bruno Gaspar is a doubt after picking up an ankle injury. Meanwhile, Chaves will be without midfielder Pedro Tiba who is out with a hamstring injury.

This should be an exciting matchup between two teams fighting for a spot in the Champions League. Rio Ave come into this clash as the favourites given their recent form, but Chaves will not be easy to beat.

#  Nacional and Boavista Vie for Relegation in the Last Match of the Season

The last match of the season in the Primeira Liga is going to be an interesting one, with Nacional and Boavista Vie fighting relegation.

Nacional is currently in 18th place in the league table, while Boavista Vie is in 20th place. The two teams are just one point apart, so the outcome of their match will determine which team gets relegated to the Segunda Liga.

Nacional has had a very poor season, and they have only managed to win four matches out of 34 games. They have scored a total of 19 goals and conceded 43 goals.

Boavista Vie has also had a poor season, and they have only managed to win four matches out of 33 games. They have scored a total of 13 goals and conceded 36 goals.

The two teams are not going into the last match of the season with much hope. However, it is still possible for them to stay up if they manage to get some good results in their final game.

Nacional will need to beat Boavista Vie by at least two goals, and they will also need some other results to go their way. If they manage to do this, they will survive relegation and Boavista Vie will be relegated instead.

Boavista Vie will need to beat Nacional by at least three goals, and they will also need some other results to go their way. If they manage to do this, they will stay up and Nacional will be relegated instead.

#  Braga Crowned Champion of the League Cup

Braga have lifted the League Cup after a 2-0 victory over Sporting Lisbon in the final.

 Goals from Ricardo Horta and Abel Ferreira sealed the win for the minnows, who have defied expectation to reach the final.

It is their first major trophy in their history, and caps off a superb season for Braga, who sit 5th in the Primeira Liga.

Sporting Lisbon were favourites to win going into the match, but could not find a way past Braga goalkeeper Matheus.

The victory is a huge upset, and will go down as one of the biggest shocks in Portuguese football history.
