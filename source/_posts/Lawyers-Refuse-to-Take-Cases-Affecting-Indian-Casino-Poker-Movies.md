#  Lawyers Refuse to Take Cases Affecting Indian Casino Poker Movies

In a unanimous decision, the Massachusetts Bar Association has announced that they will not represent any clients in legal cases affecting Indian casinos. The ruling comes as a direct result of the new poker movie released last week, <I>Just Cause</I>.

The film, which tells the story of an underdog poker player fighting for justice in the casino world, has already become a hit with audiences. However, the MAA is concerned that it may give rise to legal disputes involving gambling establishments.

"We don't want to be associated with any behavior that could be seen as promoting illegal activity," explained MAA president Christopher Hopen. "And we're certainly not going to help anyone try to take advantage of Native American tribes."

This isn't the first time that Hollywood has had an impact on the legal profession. In 1998, the release of <I>The Waterboy</I> led to a surge in Louisiana water law cases. And in 2003, the debut of <I>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</I> spawned a wave of litigation over personal injury claims.

So far, there is no word on how the Just Cause ruling will impact Hollywood's relationship with lawyers. But it's clear that this won't be the last time that movies have an impact on our legal system

#  Lawyers Fear Indian Casino Poker Movies May Cause Negative Publicity

Indian casinos are popping up all over the United States, and with them, movies about poker are becoming more popular. The trouble is that the vast majority of these movies are highly negative portrayals of lawyers.

One common trope in these movies is the scene where a group of hard-working, honest lawyers are playing poker in a casino and they are taken down by a team of corrupt lawyers who use dirty tricks to win. This kind of negative portrayal can easily lead to public perceptions that lawyers are cheats and liars.

Lawyers are understandably worried about the potential for this kind of negative publicity. Some have even called for a boycott of these movies. Others argue that it’s important to fight against the negative portrayal of lawyers, and that doing so will ultimately be good for the profession.

What do you think? Should lawyers boycott these movies, or should they fight against the negative portrayal of their profession?

#  Law Firms Drop Cases Involving Indian Casino Poker Movies

In a surprising move, many leading law firms have announced they are dropping any cases that involve Indian casino poker movies. According to spokespeople from the firms, the decision was made in order to focus on more important cases.

"The firm has decided to focus its resources on more important cases," said one spokesperson from a large law firm. "This includes white-collar crime, intellectual property theft, and other complex legal issues."

When asked why Indian casino poker movies were specifically chosen as a focus area, the spokesperson was vague.

"We feel that there are other areas of the law that are more important right now and we would like to devote our attention to those issues," he said.

It's unclear what impact this will have on the Indian casino poker movie industry. So far, no studios have commented on the decision. However, it's likely that this will have some negative consequences for the industry.

#  Lawyers Concerned About Appearance of Impropriety in Indian Casino Poker Movie-Related Litigation

In a recent turn of events, a group of lawyers have voiced concern about the appearance of impropriety in the legal case involving an Indian casino and the producers of the movie “Poker Night.” The casino filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers in January, alleging that the movie infringed on its copyright and trade secrets. The lawyers, who are not involved in the case, argue that the casino has used its financial resources to gain an unfair advantage in the litigation.

The casino is represented by two well-known law firms, while the producers of “Poker Night” are represented by a small firm with limited resources. In a letter to the court, the lawyers stated that the casino has been “aggressive in its pursuit of defendants, using significant financial resources to file motions and pursue discovery.” They added that this gives the appearance that the casino is using its power and influence to bully the filmmakers into settlement.

The letter concludes with a request that the court appoint an independent third party to investigate whether there has been any impropriety in the proceedings. The casinos’ lawyers responded by denying any wrongdoing and stating that their clients are merely seeking to protect their intellectual property. They added that they are confident that they will prevail in court.

This case highlights some of the potential dangers of using large law firms in litigation. When one party has significantly more financial resources than another, it can often use those resources to gain an advantage in court. This can create an unfair playing field and lead to an unjust result.

In light of this danger, it is important for parties involved in litigation to be aware of their rights and make sure they are being represented by attorneys who will fight for them fairly. If you believe that you are at a disadvantage because your opponent is financially stronger, be sure to speak with an attorney who can help you level the playing field.

#  No One Wants to Touch the Mess That is Indian Casino Poker Movie Litigation

Casino poker has been a popular topic in both movies and literature for as long as either have been around. The allure of making easy money, combined with the high-stakes environment, makes for an intoxicating mix.

And when it comes to Indian casinos in particular, things only seem to get more complicated – and litigious.

Just look at what’s been going on lately. For example, in December of 2016 the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians filed a lawsuit against the state of Michigan, claiming that a new law signed by Governor Rick Snyder violated their gaming compact.

At issue is a proposal that would allow three Detroit casinos to offer online gambling, including poker. The Band claims that this would effectively cut them out of the online market, since they are the only tribal casino currently offering online poker in Michigan.

The state has fired back, arguing that the new law doesn’t affect the Pokagon Band’s rights under the existing gaming compact. And Governor Snyder has even gone so far as to accuse the tribe of trying to hold the state hostage in order to gain an advantage in future negotiations.

Meanwhile, in California another battle is brewing over poker in Indian casinos. This time it’s a dispute between two tribes – the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians and the Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians – over who has the exclusive right to offer blackjack and other table games at their respective casinos.

The Pechanga Tribe claims that a provision in their gaming compact gives them exclusive rights to such games, while the Rincon Tribe argues that they have always offered blackjack at their casino and should be allowed to keep doing so.

A hearing on the matter is scheduled for January of 2017, with a decision likely coming later in the year. If the court rules in favor of Pechanga, it could set precedent for other tribes across California (and elsewhere) who are looking to expand their gambling operations beyond poker.
