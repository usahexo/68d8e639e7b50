</li>
<li><p>Thirdly, players must be able to control their emotions and make rational decisions during gameplay. This means staying cool under pressure and not making rash decisions based on impulse or emotions. Pro poker players are able to keep a clear head even when things aren’t going their way and make the best possible moves for their hand.</p>
